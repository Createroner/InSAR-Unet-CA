# Detecting Linear Deformation Features in Arctic Landfast Ice Using Radar Interferometry
## Project Overview
This project aims to automatically and accurately extract and identify linear deformation features (such as cracks, shear zones, etc.) in Arctic Landfast Ice using Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technology combined with advanced deep learning semantic segmentation models. This repository contains implementations of nine deep learning models for polar ice condition analysis, along with detailed configurations and experimental performance records.
